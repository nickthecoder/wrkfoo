Current Task
============

ctrl+Enter => command in New tab
	Old tab is blank if the option is trying to reuse the command, but changing the parameters.  

BUGS
====

PatternParameters default to regex - should it be regex? Especially for FileListerTask?

alt+F4 doesn't work
	Option "na" or "n2" on wrkf directory to start nautilus. Close nautilus, F4 fails
	However, do the same WITHOUT closing nautilus, and F4 works fine.
	Does this when using Exec and using Runtime.exec directly.
	Not related to nautilus. (I tried gnome-calculator and gedit).
	Does this when running from Eclipse and from gradle run.
	If add a break point in Enter action, continue from the break point, switch to nautilus and close it, then F4 works!!!
	This may be a Gnome or java bug, so I'll leave it for now, and try it out on other systems.

Table takes up too much width when there's scroll bars, causing the parameters panel to be squashed.
