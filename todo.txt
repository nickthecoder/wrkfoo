Current Task
============

BUGS
====

Window title not updating when changing tabs.

New Features
============
	
	When WrkFTree is written,
		allow a panel to change from one command to another, keeping the same history.
		Create a CommandProxy, which can change its Command.
		The proxy has the history.
		The history will have to include the Command, and its parameters, not the Task.

	Use the options to run other commands

	glob filter of filenames
	regex filter of filenames
	
	Hide canonical
	
	Sort keeps the folders at the top regardless of anything else.

	Ctrl+click to open a folder in a new tab.
	
			

	
Later Features
==============

	tooltips for columns
	Render dates using cleverness - Show TIME when it was changed in the last 24 hours.
		Need a custom renderer

	Filtering. See : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html

Thoughts
========
	
	Each WrkFoo has a set of WrkMores, which can operate on a row of the results.
		The WrkMore has a 2 character shortcut code, which can be typed into a text field on the left of each row
		Or double click to run the default WrkMore
		Or right click a row for a menu of each WrkMore, with a nice label (and shortcut reminder)
		
		Shortcut "o" opens the file in the default application (which will be the default WrkMore)
		Shortcut "e" on a file opens it in a text editor

		Also have a list of WrkMores which apply to the current WrkFoo, rather than one of its results
			Maybe have a TextField in the header to type these (but can also be typed into any row for the same effect)?
		Also have a list of top-level WrkMores, which do not relate to the current WrkFoo
			
	
	Object oriented - a bit like Windows power shell?
	Common result objects :
		File (wrkf)
		Database table (wrkdb)
		Database row (wrktable)
		crontab entry (wrkcron)
		Myth recording (wrkmyth)
		TV Series (wrktv)
		TV Episode (wrktve)
		git status (wrkgits)
		other git stuff (branches, commits etc)
		Pinkwino (will need a REST API)
			Pinkwino instance (so I can list all of my wikis) (wrkpw)
			namespace (wrkpwn)
			wiki Page (List Namespace, List Links, List Related Pages etc) (wrkpwp)
			Version (wrkpwv)
		To-do (from FDroid) - forgotten the name of the utility
			groups
			tasks
		To-do text files (one file for each project, using symlinks in a single directory, or just a List of files) (wrktodo)

	Persist meta-data such as
		"next episode to watch"
		current git branch?


	Advanced features (coded later)
        Multiple selections WrkMores
            e.g. select a set of files, and then :
                choose the "zip" tool to put them in a zip file.
                choose delete to delete them all
                concatenate all files into a single file
                etc

		One window, with multiple tabs, each containing a different result set
			Peal off tabs to make a new top-level window.
			Middle click to create a new tab, left click to replace the current tab with a new GUITask
			Back/Forward button to return to the previous GUITask 
			Each tab gets it name from the WrkFoo command name (such as WrkF), but can be overridden with arbitrary text

		Results are a TREE structure, rather than just a list, e.g. allowing for TV Episodes grouped into series

		An ncurses version, (good for ssh into remote servers)
