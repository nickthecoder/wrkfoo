	ncurses option, so that wrkfoo can work quickly over ssh.
		Tools and Tasks don't interact with Swing, and this was a deliberate design decision, so that an ncurses-like
		frontend could be developed.

Unresolved bugs
===============

I've spent quite on these bugs, but I'm not sure the bug is in my code, I think it may be Gnome screwing up (or maybe java). 
For now, I'm ignoring them. I'll try on a different window manager some time, and see if the bug goes away.

F4 often doesn't work

Open wrkfoo tb set "te" against a file, then F4 to close gedit sometimes closes the wrkfoo window.
	Gedit doesn't have keyboard focus, but is infront of wrkfoo window. Surely this is a gnome bug.
	Try using Swingutils.runlater?? Doesn't help!
