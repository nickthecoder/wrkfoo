BUGS

New Features
============


	Format WrkTree's path so that it is indented appropriately.
		When sorted by a different column (or path backwards), then don't do the fancy formatting.
		Just need to count the "/" and multiply by a constant for a left padding.

		If I implement "Columns.insert", then it needs to update the column indexes of tooltips and defaultSort.

	Status bar
		Error messages
		Completion message
		Stop button
		Move the "Export Table"
		
	Bring back multi row selections, and make it easy to run multi options on the selection.
		Select multiple lines, then right click pops up only multi commands
			But ctrl right click shows both kinds


Later Features

	Filtering table results. See : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html

		Drag a file to "Places", and it will append it to its places file.
