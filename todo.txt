Current Task
============

Merge stderr and out in ExecTask

BUGS
====

Command.updateResults is called from two places. CommandTab.go and AbstractCommand.GoThread.run
	Is that ok?

New Features
============

	Rename "groovy" to "action" in the options json files.
	
	Rename "Command" to "Tool" - will take a while!!!
		Including all related classes such as CommandPanel.
	
	Tar my .config/wrkfoo directory, and put it in the documents folder.
		Put the tar command in a shell script so I can run it multiple times.
		No, just copy (or symlink), don't tar.

	Right click on a tab to change the text.
		Save this info when saving tabset

	Format WrkTree's path so that it is indented appropriately.
		When sorted by a different column (or path backwards), then don't do the fancy formatting.
		Just need to count the "/" and multiply by a constant for a left padding.

		If I implement "Columns.insert", then it needs to update the column indexes of tooltips and defaultSort.

	Status bar
		Error messages
		Completion message
		Stop button
		Move the "Export Table"
		
	Bring back multi row selections, and make it easy to run multi options on the selection.
		Select multiple lines, then right click pops up only multi commands
			But ctrl right click shows both kinds


Later Features
==============

	Filtering table results. See : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html

	Implement drag and drop across the commands
		Drag a file to "Places", and it will append it to its places file.
		Copy / Move files

	FileParameters to have an icon?, which can be dropped onto a directory, which will set the dir name.
