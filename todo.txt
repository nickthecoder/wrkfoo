Current Task
============

Error handler - click the error message to see it in full and maybe the stack trace too.

Implement multi-line StringParameter, and use it for add/edit/copy of Options.

BUGS
====

Having a missing options file throws exception when the tool tries to use it.

Focus not going back to the table when running tasks/tools.

Use rm, and the current editing cell can become below the bottom of the table. use stopEditing???

RegexParameter doesn't error for empty required values.

New Features
============

Popup Menu items :
	Merge the different options files together and sort by their code??? by Label???
	Maybe make the top-level ones bold (if that is possible).
		Global options aren't bold, but included ones are?
		Use background colors? Could specify a bg colour for each options file.
		Special menuitemfilter e.g. "*" to show everything, but it usually excludes globals. "-" to only show top level options.

RegexParameter - add popup-menu for oft used constructs, such as quote, whitespace, one or more, zero of more, identifier...
	Should grep then use RegexParameter?

Add/Edit/New/Copy options doesn't support aliases. (Needs Multi-value parameter).
	Add another column.

Custom options applied to a tab
	e.g. WrkF is given more options, suitable only for images.
	Save names of custom options in tabset
	Create a global option to add a custom options file	

Allow additional packages to be imported from the settings.json into GroovyScriptlet

Later Features
==============

	Tree commands
		Rewrite wrkftree using a JTree, which gets more results when directories are opened. 

	Filtering table results. See : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html

	Implement drag and drop across the commands
		Drag a file to "Places", and it will append it to its places file.
		Copy / Move files

	FileParameters to have an icon?, which can be dropped onto a directory, which will set the dir name.

Much Later
==========

	ncurses option, so that wrkfoo can work quickly over ssh.
		Tools and Tasks don't interact with Swing, and this was a deliberate design decision, so that an ncurses-like
		frontend could be developed.

Unresolved bugs
===============

I've spent quite on these bugs, but I'm not sure the bug is in my code, I think it may be Gnome screwing up (or maybe java). 
For now, I'm ignoring them. I'll try on a different window manager some time, and see if the bug goes away.

F4 often doesn't work

Open wrkfoo tb set "te" against a file, then F4 to close gedit sometimes closes the wrkfoo window.
	Gedit doesn't have keyboard focus, but is infront of wrkfoo window. Surely this is a gnome bug.
	Try using Swingutils.runlater?? Doesn't help!
