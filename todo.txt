Current Task
============

Tool.getNewTab - is this needed any more?

Options to have a "new Tab" attribute. Tools are opened in a new tab regardless of whether ctrl was pressed.
	Use it as default for all inbuilt editor options.

BUGS
====

Editor toolbar appears when tabset is loaded, even though it isn't on the selected tab.
	Shouldn't have a list of tools passed to MainFrame constructor.
	Probably MainWindow.getMainWindow(component) is returning null

Editor doesn't offer "Close without saving" when closing the tab or opening a different document.

Editor->ctrl+O doens't focus on the file parameter

ExecTool break the convension of being defined by tool's class and parameters
	Doesn't have a non-arg constructor, so loading the tab will fail.
	Also consider re-runnable when loading/saving. Just ignore non-rerunnable when saving.
	Need a "builder"

Tabs lose their properites when dragged to a different MainWindow.

When Editor dirty changes the tab's label, the window title isn't correctly set. (Misses the "WrkFoo : " prefix)

New Features
============

Editor saveAs changes the file to getParent then does check() to force parameter to appear?
	Nah, just run a saveAs Task.
	Fire a change event so Editor can change the parameter accordingly

Exec runWhenCompleted( Runnable )


Settings Task to edit the Settings data
	Settings to show/hide toolbars. Either toolbar,statusbar or hide.
	Use EnumParameter
		EnumParameter to format the labels cleverly FOO -> Foo, FOO_BAR -> Foo Bar
	Settings to show/hide each tool bar item
		Put them into GroupParameters - a good way to force me to get this right!
	
Non-row option field in the status bar
	Settings allow the toolbars to be shown/hidden
		Non-row option field, Regular toolbar, Editor toolbar
	Global option to show the Settings Task.

MegaTabSet aka TabGroups
	Tabs down the left edge, or a pulldown list in the toolbar
	Each MegaTab has its own tabset (and must know the filename of the tabset).
	This way, I can have multiple projects in a single window.
	Ensure tab shortcuts are applied to the tabbedpane, so that they still work when a shortcut is shared by tabs in different mega-tabs.

Un-close tab. Useful when you close a tab by mistake.

Save Tab sets to remember the order and widths of the columns

Editor to prompt when closing the tab without saving (if dirty)

Task : new prompt method, designed for non-command line usage. Hides the Details button, and does neverExit.
	Search options

F4 to prompt tasks/tools.

Embed a terminal emulator :
	https://github.com/JetBrains/jediterm/tree/master/terminal/src/com/jediterm/terminal

Add/Edit/New/Copy options doesn't support aliases. (Needs Multi-value parameter).
	Add another column.

TabbedTool
	A tool, which has TWO or more tasks, and therefore many results.
	Useful when one item is made up of two different types of list.
	e.g. A wiki page has a set of versions, a set of back links, a set of forward links etc.
		So the WrkWikiPage, will have multiple tabs.
	
Popup Menu items :
	Merge the different options files together and sort by their code??? by Label???
	Maybe make the top-level ones bold (if that is possible).
		Global options aren't bold, but included ones are?
		Use background colors? Could specify a bg colour for each options file.
		Special menuitemfilter e.g. "*" to show everything, but it usually excludes globals. "-" to only show top level options.

RegexParameter - add popup-menu for oft used constructs, such as quote, whitespace, one or more, zero of more, identifier...
	Should grep then use RegexParameter?

Custom options applied to a tool
	e.g. WrkF is given more options, suitable only for images.
	Problem : For this to be useful, it needs to be added to the History, and saved in the tabset. Nasty.

Allow additional packages to be imported from the settings.json into GroovyScriptlet

Code review & Javadoc comments

Later Features
==============


Editor to have syntax highlighter choice, which is guessed based on extension when file is changed.

Allow slow running tasks to update their results periodically.
	Maybe a new updatePartialResults method???
		But then updateResults will get called at then end, invalidating the whole table. Hmm.


Tree commands
	Rewrite wrkftree using a JTree, which gets more results when directories are opened. 

Filtering table results. See : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html

Implement drag and drop across the commands
		Drag a file to "Places", and it will append it to its places file.
		Copy / Move files

FileParameters to have an icon?, which can be dropped onto a directory, which will set the dir name.

Much Later
==========

	ncurses option, so that wrkfoo can work quickly over ssh.
		Tools and Tasks don't interact with Swing, and this was a deliberate design decision, so that an ncurses-like
		frontend could be developed.
