Current Task
============

	Load / Save tabs

BUGS
====

PatternParameters default to regex - should it be regex? Especially for FileListerTask?

alt+F4 doesn't work
	Option "na" or "n2" on wrkf directory to start nautilus. Close nautilus, F4 fails
	However, do the same WITHOUT closing nautilus, and F4 works fine.
	Does this when using Exec and using Runtime.exec directly.
	Not related to nautilus. (I tried gnome-calculator and gedit).
	Does this when running from Eclipse and from gradle run.
	If add a break point in Enter action, continue from the break point, switch to nautilus and close it, then F4 works!!!
	This may be a Gnome or java bug, so I'll leave it for now, and try it out on other systems.

Table takes up too much width when there's scroll bars, causing the parameters panel to be squashed.

Duplicating commands doesn't preserve the visibility of parameters.

New Features
============

	Places
		Use Gnome's Places as the list

	Bring back multi row selections, and make it easy to run multi options on the selection.
		Select multiple lines, then right click pops up only multi commands
			But ctrl right click shows both kinds

	Buttons in a toolbar :
		Save/Load tab set : 
		Save : Dumps data as a file. cvs, plain text, html. Select which columns to display.
			Option to place the command parameters in the first line?
			Option for column names in the first row.
			Copy to clipboard for pasting into a spreadsheet.
		Filter : Filters table results, without help from the Command.


	Shortcuts for task parameters? e.g. ctrl+d to change directory, ctrl+g to filter files.

Later Features
==============

	Run tasks in a thread
		Show a "Running" status, with a Stop button (if the Task implements Stoppable).

	Filtering table results. See : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html

	Tree structures as well as tables?
		A tree structure in the left pane, and the table in the middle
		e.g. a Tree with Databases as the top level, then tables.
			Inside tables, there's an item called "data", which calls WrkTable
